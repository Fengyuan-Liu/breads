## Grinding Experiment

I chose two breads: whole wheat toast and rye square. The Average group means grinding with the coffee machines for 5 seconds and the Small group means grinding with the coffee machines for 15 seconds (5 + 5 + 5). The results are shown as below (error bars represent mean ± range, n = 2):

### Summary

It seems that griding for 5 seconds is enough, because the difference between these two groups was small. 

## Lipase Experiment

I chose two breads: rye toast and oat square, as they contain the highest fat content among the samples. The amount of lipase added to the intestinal digestion was based on the lipase activity on the Sigma bottle, which is ≥ 700 U/mg. Since the recommended lipase activity is 2000 U/ml in the Infogest protocol, so the amount of lipase added in **each digestion tube** was 2000*40/700 = 114 mg. The results are shown as below (error bars represent mean ± range, n = 2, the repetition was digestion replicate):

### Summary

It seems that the addition of lipase in the intestinal phase have little impact on the folate level of the digesta. The additon of lipase made the folate level lower. This could confirm that the early disruption of food structure would be bad for folate. However, the impact of it might be small as we can see from the figure. In additon, the amount of folate in the lipase is huge, most of them are 5-CH3-H4. 

### Question

Should we repeat the lipase experiment? What do you think? If we do, then we should determin the activity. I have asked Marjo about Zhen's protocol, maybe I could try.
