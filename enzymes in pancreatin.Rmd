# Enzymes

I have tested the activities of all the enzymes available and below are the results:

## Old Pancreatin (P1750-100G)
lot number: SLBR5608V

Enzyme       | Activity (U/mg)
------------ | ---------------
Amylase      | 24.2
Trypsin      | 2.2
Chymotrypsin | 1.0
Lipase       | 32.2

## New Pancreatin (P7545-100G)
lot number: SLBM0006V

Enzyme       | Activity (U/mg)
------------ | ---------------
Amylase      | 66.6
Trypsin      | 4.1
Chymotrypsin | 2.1
Lipase       | 64.9

## New Individual Enzymes Purchased Last Year

Enzyme       | Activity (U/mg) | Product Code & Lot#
------------ | --------------- | -------------------
Amylase      | 107.1           | A9857-MU SLBZ1496
Trypsin      | 111.1           | T0303-10G SCCBF350
Chymotrypsin | 45.6            | C4129-10G SLBV2540

If we use the new pancreatin, and based on the activity of trypsin (100 U/mL), we need to add 100*40/4.1 = 976 mg in one tube. The activity of **amylase and chymotrysin** will be **lager** than the recomended values, but the activity of **lipase** will be **smaller**. One bottle is 100 G, so we can perform about **100** tubes totally using one bottle of this new pancreatin. 


# Sample for the Test 

I am going to test it with oat flour and oat bread (commercial oat bread)
